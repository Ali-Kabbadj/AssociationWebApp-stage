                <p class="margin-top-10">Madison grew up playing soccer in the local Chicago park leagues. By age 13, Madison had developed into one of the top players in the area. Her coach, who was also her dad, implemented a special rule for her to make the games fair. </p>
                <p>“It was a 3 goal rule. Once I scored three goals, I couldn’t score anymore so that other girls on the team could score,” Madison said.</p>
                <p>In 1998, her talent and sportsmanship caught the eye of a male referee who approached her and her dad after a game. The referee wanted to know if Madison would be interested in becoming a referee.</p>
