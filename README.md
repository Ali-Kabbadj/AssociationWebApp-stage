This is a web application ,built with .Net core using MVC pattern .

Devaloped for an association to dispaly their information ,projects ,events , locations... and a contact form

I wasnt provided with enough information about the association , and that made the prosses of creating the right pages and their layouts not that intuitive,
so what i did to solve this is to created an admin space that allows the admin to contmiz every page , the pagargarphs/titles/images/locations/events/news... and the Email box .
